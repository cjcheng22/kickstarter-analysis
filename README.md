# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project: Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create.

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges
Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. May launch date has the most number of successful campaigns
2. Dec launch date has almost the same successful and failed campaigns 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. The kickstarter campaign goal set for less than $1,000 are most likely to be successful
2. The kickstarter campaign goal set between $45,000 and $49,999 does fails are most likely to fail
3. The kickstarter campaign with goals set for less than $15,000, and campaign with goal set for between $35,000 and $45,000 are more likely to succeed than to fail

- What are some limitations of this dataset?


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
